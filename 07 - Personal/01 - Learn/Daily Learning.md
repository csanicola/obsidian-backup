# Notes

### Daily Learning Goals

## **Day 1: Monday | Science & Technology**

- **Date: 3/18/24**
    
- **Topic: Astronomy**
    
- **Source(s):** [The top 5 astronomical discoveries of all time (so far)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/a-cosmologists-guide-to-the-greatest-astronomical-discoveries-of-all-time/)
    
- **Key Questions:** What are the important discoveries in astronomy?
    
- **What I Learned:** I learned that there are at least 5 crucial discoveries in the field of astronomy that shape modern studies. The first being how the circumference of the Earth was first discovered, the second is one of the first sets of laws describing the universe which helped transition from geocentric beliefs to a heliocentric model, the third was thanks to Hubble and his telescope, confirming the belief that the universe is expanding that that everything moves in the universe, the fourth is the concept of black holes and that there is still too much we don’t currently know about that but that its more of an acceptance that they exist than before, and the fifth and final is the big bang and the idea that its where we get our elements that make up the periodic table and what types of stars create which elements.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Much of astronomy in the beginning was just philosophy that was slowly proven to be fact and in the process also created the concept of physics. There is still ALOT that we do not know and will probably never know until there is more concrete evidence.
    
- **How It Connects:** Watching a lot of science fiction shows and reading books, you can see where and what is pulled from fact and what is purely fiction but its nice to have scripted visual representations of things because most of what astronomy is all about is really hard to grasp without seeing some sort of visual aid to make it understandable for normal people.
    
- **Potential Applications:** I want to get more involved with knowing when there are big astronomical events that are once in a lifetime and actually know what they mean and the significance to science.

## **Day 2: Tuesday | History & Culture**

- **Date: 3/19/24**
    
- **Topic: Medieval Women Expressing Emotion**
    
- **Source(s):** [How Medieval Women Expressed Their ‘Forbidden’ Emotions](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-medieval-women-expressed-their-forbidden-emotions-180983953/)
    
- **Key Questions:** I want to know more about the Medieval time period but from a woman’s perspective which is not always accurately described or even recorded in history.
    
- **What I Learned:** Women in general have always been repressed by men but for historical purposes, their stories are rarely documented especially in older times. The medieval times were when woman were not allowed to express emotions but instead needed to find other outlets instead which included writing letters and creating embroidery. The problem with this too is that these were really only privilege's of the upper class so lower class woman are very under represented in history during this time by what is remembered/left behind by them. Letters used to be a good political tool too by being able to use words to get what you want and manipulate others which seems to be what a lot of medieval mothers did back then.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Emotions are a powerful weapon that can be used as a tool of repression.
    
- **How It Connects:** I always would watch historical movies and think how pathetic is was that all these women did in them was sit and stitch and talk to each other with idle gossip but now I realize that those things are just the few forms of entertainment and expression that a woman would have in those days which really put my views into perspective.
    
- **Potential Applications:** I now have a better understanding of the art and embroidery back then and I want to read more of the letters from then and actually look up what the phrases and words mean.

## **Day 3: Wednesday | Arts & Literature**

- **Date: 3/20/24**
    
- **Topic: Geometry and Angles in Art**
    
- **Source(s):** [What Do Artists Mernet Larsen and Diane Simpson Have In Common? A Fascination With the 45-Degree Angle](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/diane-simpson-mernet-larsen-2451167)
    
- **Key Questions:** What does the role of geometry and angles play in the art world?
    
- **What I Learned:** Based on the two gallery exhibit pieces by Mernet Larsen and Diane Simpson, their art focuses heavily on angles and particularly the 45 degree angle. Mernet mostly focuses on paintings (which she does incorporate actual photographs within the picture) but all featuring the people in block like designs where their bodies and positions are angular. All of her pieces force a different perspective when looking at it. Diane is another artist who uses more structures (and her pieces are primarily from the 70s and 80s) but still utilizes angles with pieces of carboard she props together without using any tape or glue and when you look at the pieces its another forced perspective.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Geometry and angles in art aren’t noticed until there is a change to the normal orientation or form of an object or person and then it becomes a crucial part of the piece that can give it a whole different meaning. Anything angular automatically forces an alternative perspective to viewing the piece straight on which can be really interesting in a gallery setting with the ability to view from multiple positions.
    
- **How It Connects:** Going to museums and galleries, it’s hard to get into the structural art because most of the time it seems like piles of garbage or junk just rearranged in a different way but actually thinking about the angles and knowing all of that is taken into consideration will give me a different perspective the next time I view art.
    
- **Potential Applications:** I am now very curious about geometric specific pieces and artists who mainly focus in different angles or shapes especially with how unique Mernet’s people are and how they both look high concept art but also like children’s play dolls.

## **Day 4: Thursday | Economics & Politics**

- **Date: 3/21/24**
    
- **Topic: Multilateralism, the WTO and Developing Countries**
    
- **Source(s):** [Why Have Developing Countries Soured on Multilateralism?](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/multilateralism-wto-in-crisis-when-developing-countries-dont-see-the-benefits-by-pinelopi-koujianou-goldberg-2024-03)
    
- **Key Questions:** I try to stay out of politics and the economy so this is just a baby step into it so I’m coming in with basic high school knowledge
    
- **What I Learned:** Instead of the usual one to one agreements, multilateralism is for countries when there needs to be multiple countries entering into an agreement. Mainly this word is used for NATO and WTO purposes which is what this article was about. The developing countries are against this and WTO because of the change in commerce with the move to more digital content. But the problem is that the more powerful countries tend to have the final say with things so the developing countries are at their beck and call. Developing countries also don’t have strong domestic economies to fall back on like larger countries so they can’t be as aggressive in negotiations.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Despite there being many disadvantages, especially with the change in commerce, for developing countries, multilateralism is still an important system that should remain in place. Comparing it now to what was being done in Nazi Germany like the article does, it shows how there are checks and balances in place to help negate power struggles. There needs to be, however, more consideration for developing countries and what they lack.
    
- **How It Connects:** Knowing a bit about Thailand (which is mentioned) and the comparisons to Nazi Germany made this easy to understand what the flaws and benefits to multilateralism. Also know the rise in trends towards digital e-commerce makes this all the more important as the trend will only increase not decrease so a solution will be needed eventually.
    
- **Potential Applications:** Although this doesn’t apply to me personally, it was definitely interesting to learn about and helped me further understand global politics and economy.

## **Day 5: Friday | Personal Development & Psychology**

- **Date: 3/22/24**
    
- **Topic: Blue Light and Sleep**
    
- **Source(s):** [The Fifth Generation of Light Has Arrived](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-light-doctor/202403/the-fifth-generation-of-light-has-arrived)
    
- **Key Questions:** As someone who spends 99.9% of my daily live indoors and has difficulty waking up or keeping a proper sleep schedule without alarms, this is especially relevant to me and my lifestyle.
    
- **What I Learned:** Over the course of human history from the discovery of fire, there have been different light sources introduced to humans that have slowly started to worsen sleep cycles which in turn has created detrimental health effects. The first generation of light was just using the sun during the day and sleeping at night, the second generation was fire and candles, the third was the first light bulbs by edison, and the fourth generation was the push in 2014 for blue light enriched lighting for conservation efforts of the planet but this is when the downfall really began. Having a certain blue light wavelength is a way to alert the body whether it is day or night but the newer LED light bulbs produce too much blue wavelengths so it is throwing off sleep patterns. The fifth generation of light is the effort to create light bulbs that lack this blue light in order to restore the correct circadian rhythm which already is showing very prominent results in the various professions that the light was installed in to test out. The goal is to replace all lights and also computer screens with this new light.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Light sources have a huge roll in circadian rhythm which can result in many health issues if blue light in particular is used at night disrupting when the body thinks its supposed to be night.
    
- **How It Connects:** As someone who almost exclusively uses blue light emitting devices at night and is indoors most of the day, this is incredibly relevant to my lifestyle. However, the practicality of not using these devices at night is low so the idea that there are new lights being developed to help fix this for people is something I am very invested in. It was also very informative learning how many things that were affected after the study of people using blue lights and people who weren’t and knowing that I experience many similar things as the people who used it were.
    
- **Potential Applications:** I would like to think that this has made me reconsider using so many blue light devices at night time but practically that probably won’t happen. I will try and be more mindful and try and reduce use closer to bedtime to help as much as I can though.

## **Day 6: Wednesday | Arts & Literature**

- **Date: 3/27/24**
    
- **Topic: Death of Richard Serra**
    
- **Source(s):** [Richard Serra, Who Recast Sculpture on a Massive Scale, Dies at 85](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/arts/richard-serra-dead.html)
    
- **Key Questions:** Who are the more modern artists that are/were alive during my time that deserve equal recognition to the classic painters everyone is already familiar with?
    
- **What I Learned:** Richard Serra, although not initially starting out as one, was a very well known sculpture with a lengthy career that includes pieces exhibited all over the world. He is most famous for his works with steel that does not require any welding or bolts and is just secure with how it is standing on its own is different curved forms. His family did support his art career early on but with his fathers experience in shipyards and Richards young work as a shipyard attendant, he was already very familiar with steel. When he was first in art school, however, he was strictly a painter and it wasn’t until later he transitioned to steel. He is quoted as saying he already knew about the medium so why not take a crack at it. During his time he was accredited for being part of the minimalist movements but now he is referred to as being part of the post-minimalist movement and he himself doesn’t care for the traditional minimalism with perfect color corrected shapes and likes the raw authentic industrial looking steel and even wants his pieces to be touched and walked through and around.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Seeing someone at their death being praised for using a material that wasn’t traditionally used or even himself thought of using but with such a fixation and early life experience with it, it all came natural to him. This really shows that its not always worth fighting something that you are instinctually passionate about or just something you have a natural familiarity with.
    
- **How It Connects:** Its interesting to read an obituary about a famous artist that was appreciated during his lifetime instead of only appreciated afterwards and with my new appreciation for sculpture pieces, it was very interesting to see and learn about his work and process.
    
- **Potential Applications:** Not taking for granted sculptures but also the setup/structure that might not seem complex but actually is, is something I will try to do from now on.

## **Day 7: Monday | Science & Technology**

- **Date: 4/1/24**
    
- **Topic: The evolution of flight speed and the possibilities of the future**
    
- **Source(s):** [The company building a rotating detonation engine is pushing the tech forward](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/venus-aerospace-takes-flight-as-it-progresses-with-tests-of-novel-engine/)
    
- **Key Questions:** There is many things in society that have stalled in advancement from its initial discovery and flights seem like one of them especially with some of the regression we are currently experiencing in society so it is interesting to see some people are still trying to find ways to advance.
    
- **What I Learned:** There is a small 75-person company called Venus Aerospace that is currently testing different engines for trying to achieve mach 9 speed for that to be the eventual goal for flights. The place where they are testing it, however, does not allow speeds faster than the speed of light so testing has been limited. Currently places travel at around 1 mach with the concord planes reaching mach 2. Realistically they will achieve around 3-4 for commercial flights but mach 9 is currently the goal.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** Current flights are hovering around 1-2 mach so to have any type of flying for the common person to be any higher is exciting but also there are safety and other factors to consider. The stages of increasing flight are in such early stages that it will be a while before this becomes commercialized but still the capabilities are exciting to know it may be possible at all.
    
- **How It Connects:** Recently the news has been focusing on the failures of planes with the planes literally falling apart while in air so it is especially relevant to see a company try to turn flying around to make it more efficient for everyone involved.
    
- **Potential Applications:** If speeds of flights are reduced to such an extreme, it will be interesting to see how this can improve so many things in society like travel, shipping, communication, events, etc. This can be extremely life changing globally so I would be very interesting to see this change in my lifetime.

## **Day 8: Tuesday | History & Culture**

- **Date: 4/2/24**
    
- **Topic: Spinning Fish**
    
- **Source(s):** [Florida Fish Are Mysteriously Dying After ‘Spinning and Whirling’ and Scientists Can’t Explain It](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/florida-fish-are-mysteriously-dying-after-spinning-and-whirling-and-scientists-cant-explain-it-180984073/)
    
- **Key Questions:** Fish especially raw fish are one of my favorite meals so this is especially concerning if the cases of this are rising and spreading across the globe impacting what I will possibly eventually eat
    
- **What I Learned:** For the smalltooth sawfish species in Florida, 28 have died (109 have been seen spinning) within the last month and nobody has been able to figure out why yet but parasites have been ruled out. But the sawfish aren’t the only fish that have been affected by this and there are up to at least 40 species with sightings of this phenomenon. The problem is that this is all currently unexplained and there are actually social media posts and real conservation attempts to figure out why this is happening and if anyone sites anything to send in a video or let the conservationists know so they can investigate.
    
- **Key Takeaways:** There really wasn’t much to this story because its still a developing story but its still a big concern for not only myself but for people globally because there have been news reports of this not just happening in America but I found an article from Canada as well.
    
- **How It Connects:** Since I love eating fish, and also this being something that is happening in the ocean which has HUGE impacts, this is very important to me in impacting what I’m eating or thinking about eating in the future and it will be very interesting to find out ultimately what is the cause because most people will just think its the fish behaving silly without seeing the detrimental effects this can have.
    
- **Potential Applications:** Knowing about the ant circles of death and the unexplained sheet/goats that have been seen circling in the night in eastern countries, the animals around the world behaving this way is really telling that the future is not looking good for anyone living.

## **Day 9: Wednesday | Arts & Literature**

- **Date: 4/3/24**
- **Topic: The Gloomy Fate of Small Publishers**
- **Source(s):** [The Small Press World is About to Fall Apart: On the Collapse of Small Press Distribution](https://lithub.com/the-small-press-world-is-about-to-fall-apart-on-the-collapse-of-small-press-distribution/)
- **Key Questions:** As an avid reader, I will be devastated if books especially by small publishers, will slowly dwindle into non-existence of any kind
- **What I Learned:** One of the last small press distributors all of a sudden closed without sudden notice and owing many publishers thousands of dollars so everyone is currently panicking what this means and what will be the future of small book publishers who can’t afford the larger distributors. Distributors are the ones in the book process that take the books from the publishers and make sure they are sent where they need to go including promotions and fulfilling orders like for Barnes & Nobles and schools. There was whistle blowing incident that happened earlier for this company but there hasn’t been any press about it since and now this happening shows that the company was on the decline for at least a little while. If the smaller publishers can’t afford the large distributors and the minimums and fees associated, then we might see a huge decline in the production of books especially niche ones.
- **Key Takeaways:** Books unable to be distributed means that the publishers are no longer being paid and books will be sitting in warehouses unable to be distributed to where people can read/buy them.
- **How It Connects:** Reading has always been a huge part of my life and with the increase in reading within the last couple of years, this is devestating to me because I read such a large variety of books, and especially the LGBT books I read, I don’t want to think that most of these books could completely disappear in the future because the authors can’t afford to have their book distributed by the large distributors.
- **Potential Applications:** Since this just happened and publishers themselves are creating gofundmes and having emergency zoom meetings, this is something that we don’t know how it will end up but I am very invested in what the future could mean.

## **Day 10: Thursday | Economics & Politics**

- **Date: 4/4/24**
- **Topic: Cutting Interest Rates**
- **Source(s):** [Switzerland becomes first major economy to cut interest rates in surprise move](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/switzerland-becomes-first-major-economy-to-cut-interest-rates-in-surprise-move.html)
- **Key Questions:** Finally attempting to understand interest rates and what lowering or raises them does to an economy
- **What I Learned:** The national Swiss bank decided to lower the interest rate because they think the price of goods and cost of living won’t raise anytime soon so they thought increasing the ability for people to borrow money by making it cheaper would be the better option. Seeing as how Switzerland is one of the best places to live and the country is one of the highest quality of life, this is important to know and watch because whatever they do should be considered an example of what to do. It is interesting to see that the boss of the swiss bank is leaving and decided to do this before leaving, making it seem suspicious but so far things are looking good for switzerland.
- **Key Takeaways:** Lowering interest rates by many countries is considered a terrible idea and a last case resort but with Switzerland committing to this now shows that they have a better idea of what it will really take to improve the economy.
- **How It Connects:** I currently know very little about the economy and politics and interest rates so this was interesting to read as a beginning to how all of this works.
- **Potential Applications:** I will now have a better idea of what interest rates are and how they affect an economy and what it could mean for the future of goods and money.

## **Day 11: Friday | Personal Development & Psychology**

- **Date: 4/5/24**
- **Topic: Antibiotics & AI**
- **Source(s):** [Generative AI Designs New Antibiotics From Scratch](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-future-brain/202404/generative-ai-designs-new-antibiotics-from-scratch)
- **Key Questions:** AI has changed the way people live their lives but one of the coolest ways so far that I’ve seen is that scientists are using AI to develop new antibiotics by using its high processing speed and ability to “think”. They created a special AI that is told to take the building blocks of drugs and run through all different permutations of it to see what would be the most effect. Since the drug industry costs billions however, the process to develop and get a drug approved takes billions and and years and not all drugs are even approved in the end (around only 7% make it to phase one). So the idea that AI can do this with significantly less money and time means that this can change everything. Especially for the specific type of drug they are developing is to stop antimicrobial resistance which is a huge problem people are currently phasing with a wide variety of illnesses.
- **What I Learned:** Not only can AI be used to write papers and push limits with words, coding and images, now AI is branching further into the world of science and biology with this new innovation of drug design which is something I didn’t know what even possible but this is only the beginning.
- **Key Takeaways:** AI will affect the drug industry in the future by speeding through the initial phases of drug creation saving billions and years which will hopefully lead to and increase in drug development and FDA approval to help cure a whole variety of illnesses
- **How It Connects:** I’ve been a big supporter of AI since it came out so this is super cool to even know something like this is possible and that its being put to the test with valuable results
- **Potential Applications:** I’m constantly trying to discover more and more things that AI can do so reading about this has just opened the door wider and has given me new ideas for how I can continue integrating AI into my own life
