# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
Today was productive, exhausting, frustrating and overwhelming. Mom is eating less and less and is weaker and weaker and it’s becoming more physically evident. But Uncle Eddie being here and helping putting in the basement light and showing me what to do with the sand and the shower in the alleyway. So moving the sand and fixing the side made me feel pretty productive and especially needing an hour nap afterwards was kind of counter productive. Also telling Eddie, who inevitably told Barbara and the rest of the siblings about mom staying in her room for days at a time and generally how weak she is prompted everyone to freak out and Danny to offer to drive ASAP to bring a cane or whatever else she needs and just the general discussion with everyone about when to move her bed to the first floor or getting the chair to go up the stairs…has just been very overwhelming all together. Today also surprisingly involved a lot of actual work to do but also made me second guess a lot of things with how I was performing the analysis for Ila and whether or not I am confidently able to say I know what I’m doing. I do want to continue trying to work on learning more code to advance in analytics but it’s just very hard to concentrate on anything right now.
