### Journal

After a busy weekend with the West family, back this morning in Roxbury having brought more boxes down and transitioning back into normal day to day living. It just felt annoying still having stuff in the apartment because I just want to be done with it and have everything here already.

### [[Plan of Action]]
- [x] work on non surgery transplant list
- [ ] put away the stuff I brought from Holtsville
- [x] ask Uncle Danny about money and what to do   
- [ ]
