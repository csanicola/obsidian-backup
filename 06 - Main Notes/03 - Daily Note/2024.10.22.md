# DAILY NOTE
## October 22nd, 2024 7:55 AM

### Journal

Ironic that the first Daily Note that is in here was the one of the days of mom’s decline when now she is no longer here. It became a lot and went downhill very quickly to the point where I haven’t been able to catch my breath since getting that first phone call. Although there is a part of is finally feeling a sense of relief because having the constant anxiety and wondering what else could happen because of how it was always bad news and now that going away is relaxing but for all the wrong reasons. I’ve also been doing things nonstop with how many people kindly offering their time and services but all I’ve really wanted to do is rot in bed and do absolutely nothing. I would love to finally get back to that but with my calendar for the next few weeks at least, that doesn’t seem like a possibility.
