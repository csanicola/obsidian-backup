# DAILY NOTE

### Journal

It’s been exactly a month since mom has passed away…
I’ve done nothing to honor her or even acknowledge her passing because I’m afraid once I open those floodgates, there is no coming back. My brain is just not accepting she is gone and a large majority of it is still annoyed with how much I had to “mother” her my entire life instead of the one getting mothered by their own mother. It feels nice living in this house alone though but most of the days I just want to be laying in bed doing nothing, I just don’t have all of my stuff here yet and I bet when I do it will really start to sink in. I need to appreciate the house more and sit outside and go for walks… I just am being too lazy and would rather drink and lay around doing nothing productive except distract my brain. The overreliance I have on distractions like Fayeyoko is probably concerning and if something happens to them like Freenbecky that will be my downfall. I will actually have to face my feelings which I am not ready to do.
