# DAILY NOTE
##  October 29th, 2024 08:41

### Journal

Another day of waking up when its the last thing I want to do. Each day there is so many things I need to do but I keep mentally putting them off for “tomorrow’s” problem and I need to stop doing that. There is too much needing to be done around the house and as lazy as I want to be, I cannot afford that. I need to stop being in the “poor me” mindset and realize everyone is going through rough times and mine are no different or special so I need to get over myself and go back to being a productive person.
