	- good for simplifying obsidian and really creating notes that are worth while to what you would need to reference going forward and to actually understand what you are writing.

	- has a great portion of the video that really breaks down why writing things out especially in your own words is important to actually learning something instead of just copying down a quote and moving on which is definitely something I’ve been guilty of, especially with AI and being able to summarize things without any input from my own brain making it almost impossible to be useful and remember long-term.
