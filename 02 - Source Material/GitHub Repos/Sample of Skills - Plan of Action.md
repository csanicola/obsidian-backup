‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database_Data_Modeling/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Excel_Projects/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SQL_Projects/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PowerBI_Reports/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.pbix
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2.pbix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data_Governance/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```

Each main folder represents a key skill area, containing individual projects that demonstrate your proficiency.
